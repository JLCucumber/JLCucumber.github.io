## About Me

I am currently a Master's student at University College London (UCL), specializing in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. My research focuses on lightweight quadruped robot locomotion, reinforcement learning, and Sim2Real transfer, particularly in training robots to navigate complex terrains. I completed my Bachelor's in Robotics at Heriot-Watt University and Ocean University of China, and I am also interested in embodied intelligence, human-robot interaction and robotics for real-world applications.
